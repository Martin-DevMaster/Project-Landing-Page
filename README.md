# Project-Landing-Page
# I tried something new, so I strayed a little bit from initial project design for landing page, but site is pretty similar to the actual design.
# I tried to keep the CSS code as simple as possible, I used CUBE method but I am still learning it, so I probably messed up a lot.
# I used mostly flex-box except for middle cards which I used grid.
# Reponsiveness was made with media queries.
